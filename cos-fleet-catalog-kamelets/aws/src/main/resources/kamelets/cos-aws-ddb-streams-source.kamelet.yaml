    description: |-
      Receive events from Amazon DynamoDB Streams.

      The basic authentication method for the AWS DynamoDB Streams service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.

      If you use the default credentials provider, the DynamoDB Streams client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.
